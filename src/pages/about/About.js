      <p>
        I bring an embedded design perspective to every project I undertake. I
        strive to make sure that the software experiences I deliver to my
        clients are seamless, intuitive, and deliver as much value as possible.
        I seek to foster a culture of continuous improvement with my clients,
        always keeping a line of communication open so I can deliver constant
        improvement to their software experience.
