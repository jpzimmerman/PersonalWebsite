        <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
        These days, clients deserve a software experience that is secure,
        reliable, and supported by engineers committed to quality and continuous
        improvement. I believe in assuming{" "}
        <strong> maximum personal ownership</strong> over every application in
        my care, and in using my craft to deliver the{" "}
        <strong>greatest possible impact</strong> for our clients. I celebrate
        the successes delivered by my applications, and take personal
        responsiblity for their failures.
