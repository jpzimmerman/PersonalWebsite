      <h3>My History</h3>
      I've always had a passion for creating software applications with a focus
      on efficiency, user-friendliness, gamification where possible, and tight
      designs that make the most of the hardware. Most of the experience I've
      gained has been in the .NET ecosystem, but I've focused in recent years on
      expanding my toolkit to specialize in MEAN, MERN, NoSQL, and Cloud
      development. <br></br>
      <br></br>I worked in a data entry role at Rocket Mortgage for several
      years, but I still brought a passion for technology and an eye for process
      improvement to the work in any way I could. After developing a few Excel
      VBA-based tools to improve my team's workflow, and working with a team to
      develop a VR accessibility training experience as part of a
      rapid-development initiative, I was selected to participate in a
      full-stack software development bootcamp at Grand Circus in Detroit.
      There, I would combine everything I'd learned as a hobbyist up to that
      point with industry-standard tools and workflows, and I began my career as
      a software engineer in earnest. <br></br>
      <br></br>I worked for four years on the Document Services team at Rocket,
      and set about the business of creating value wherever I could. I
      streamlined and refactored the company's document batch processor to
      achieve a 55% reduction in per-batch processing time, I became the team's
      subject matter expert on and point-of-contact on complex third-party
      vendor software, and shared the knowledge so that we could achieve
      long-wishlisted initiatives within the company. I wrote and maintained a
      "little app that could" that automated away a tedious manifest generation
      process for the team members I supported, and I contributed to the
      development and support of mission-critical Web applications to make the
      day-to-day work of our business partners as easy as possible.<br></br>
      <br></br>Now that I've cut my teeth and gained this experience in Agile
      development within an enterprise organization, I'm looking to bring my
      skills and expertise to a new opportunity.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <h3>My Philosophy</h3>I believe in assuming{" "}
      <strong> personal ownership</strong> over every application in my care,
      and in using my craft to deliver <strong>maximum impact</strong> for our
      clients. I celebrate the successes delivered by my applications, and take
      personal responsibility for their failures.
