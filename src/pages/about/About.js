      <hr></hr>
      <h3>My History</h3>
      I've always had a passion for creating software applications with a focus
      on efficiency, user-friendliness, gamification where possible, and tight
      designs that make the most of the hardware. Most of the experience I've
      gained has been in the .NET ecosystem, but I've focused in recent years on
      expanding my toolkit to specialize in MEAN, MERN, NoSQL, and Cloud
      development. <br></br>
      <br></br>I completed a full-stack software development bootcamp from Grand
      Circus in Detroit, and I worked for four years as a software engineer for
      Rocket Mortgage. I worked on the Document Services team, creating value
      wherever I could: I streamlined and refactored the company's document
      batch processor to achieve a 55% reduction in per-batch processing time, I
      became the team's subject matter expert on and point-of-contact on complex
      third-party vendor software, and I shared the knowledge so that we could
      achieve long-wishlisted initiatives within the company. I wrote and
      maintained a "little app that could" that automated away a tedious
      manifest generation process for the team members I supported, and I
      contributed to the development and support of mission-critical Web
      applications to make the day-to-day work of our business partners as easy
      as possible.<br></br>
      <br></br>Now that I've cut my teeth and gained this experience in Agile
      development within an enterprise organization, I'm looking to bring my
      skills and expertise to a new opportunity.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <h3>My Philosophy</h3>I believe in assuming{" "}
      <strong> extreme ownership</strong> over every application in my care, and
      in using my craft to deliver <strong>maximum impact</strong> for our
      clients. I celebrate the successes delivered by my applications, and take
      personal responsibility for their failures.
